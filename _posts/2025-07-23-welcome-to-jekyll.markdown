# July 20-22, 2025

We held our first VIS-SEA meeting on July 20-22 at Emory University, hosted by [Emily Wall](https://emilywall.github.io/). [Emily](https://emilywall.github.io/), [Katy Williams](https://kawilliams.github.io/), [Lane Harrison](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~ltharrison/?_gl=1*1rsclhf*_gcl_au*MjAwNzU0Mjk0MC4xNzUzMzg0NjMy*_ga*MTAzNDc3NTYzOS4xNzUzMzg0NjMy*_ga_RE35PKQB7J*czE3NTMzODQ2MzEkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTMzODQ2MzIkajYwJGwwJGgw), and [Cindy Xiong Bearfield](https://cyxiong.com/) organized the gathering, which had over 20 attendees participate at various events.

Sunday, July 20 we gathered for dinner at The General Muir. The eight guests were able to meet each other and hear where everyone was coming from, ranging from a (now tenured) professor at Clemson to an undergraduate student at Emory.

Monday, July 21 was the meat of the meeting. We started the day with an introductions game, followed by splitting into teams to research possibile options for our afternoon activity in the Atlanta area. Suprisingly, the Atlanta-heavy crowd opted for the [CDC Museum](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/index.htm) -- a change-up for the locals, who had already seen the Coca-Cola Museum and the Georgia Aquarium. 

After a coffee break, each person brainstormed ideas for our Unconference. An unconference is where the attendees determine the session topics at the beginning of the meeting -- rather than the organizers prescribing the topics for each session. Lots of ideas came up, ranging from finding research topics to presenting to collaboration.

*The finalized topics: LLMs and Evaluation, PhD Research, Lab Culture, Design, Collaboration Outside of Our Community, Collaboration Inside of Our Community, Money ($$/Grants), VIS-XP, Career Talk, Future Research Directions, Teaching, Presentation.*

Following lunch, we reconvened into our three parallel sessions for the afternoon:
1. PhD Research
2. Career Talks
3. Presentation

The conversations continued until our afternoon break, when we all shared rides over to the CDC Museum.

After an extensive car search (the museum *is* a government building and is part of the greater CDC complex), we all wandered around the exhibits and enjoyed learning how disease and social factors shaped history. We ended the day with dinner at Srithai: Thai Kitchen and Sushi Bar.

The following day, some folks had to leave so we had a lively, intimate discussion about teaching. We discussed developing and teaching MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), remote summer classes, and dynamics in the classroom.

*Optional topics for the second day of the unconference: LLMs + Eval + Future Research Directions, Lab Culture and Collaboration, Design and VIS+X (VIS and VR, VIS and the humanities, etc.).*

We closed with some ideas for future iterations of this meet-up:
* Co-host takes on host role at their university/area next year
  * Involve students in planning/hosting
* Provide student-centered sessions and all-attendee sessions
  * Potential presentation/poster session for only students on a half day
  * Then all-attendee sessions on the full day
* Move the half day session to the first day, then have a full day
  * Half day is aimed at students, "summer school" like at Boston VIS, culminating with an opening dinner for all attendees
  * Full day is the main event for everyone, ending early-ish (4-5 PM) so that folks can drive home

If you have additional ideas, please send them to Katy Williams (kawilliams@davidson.edu).

Thank you all for attending!
