# VIS-SEA

Welcome to VISualization in the SouthEAst, or VIS-SEA! We're an interest group of researchers who care about data visualization. Founded in 2025, the group is comprised of a mix of practitioners in both industry and academia, sprinkled across the southeastern United States. If you'd like to get on our mailing list, please complete [this 2-minute form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK4UZcyQnF-zMmITOG83dTTZb10hDZKBk9cPB2Kbvc8ztdNw/viewform?usp=dialog).

*Attendees of the first VIS-SEA meeting. We had guests from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Guests were from (in alphabetical order) 3iap, Apple, Clemson University, Davidson College, Emory University, Georgia Tech, and UNC Charlotte (plus Lane from WPI -- but he's a native North Carolinian so he said he counts).*
