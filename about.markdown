  VIS-SEA (VISualization in the South EAst) is an interest group for 
  data visualization researchers and afficionados in the Southeastern 
  United States. We hope to foster local community and to host events
  on a regular basis so that more people can get involved in the data visualization
  community. 

  This group was formally established in 2025, although informal gatherings between Georgia Tech and Emory University had occurred for quite some time. The organizers reached out to large and small schools and industry practitioners across the southeast to garner interest. Attendees to the first VIS-SEA gathering arrived from Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We hope to recruit more members across the southeast.
